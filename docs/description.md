*event scripts* are stored in 
**SSR\_CONFIG\_DIR**/events\* ,
as executable files with the same name as the
event (delay|pause|resume|start|stop).
When **ssrt** is launched for the first time a sample
`events` directory will be created but
the scripts are *"empty"*.

> \* SSR\_CONFIG\_DIR defaults to simplescreenrecorders
> configuration directory: `~/.ssr`
